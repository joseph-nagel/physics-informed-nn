# Physics-informed neural nets

![The exact solution of a 1D heat conduction problem](assets/solution.svg)

The goal of this project is to provide an introduction to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
For phenomena that can be mathematically described by certain differential equations,
PINNs establish a predictive modeling approach that is both physics-guided and data-driven.
Everything here is work in progress at this point.

## Overview
A concise introduction to PINNs can be found in [this notebook](notebooks/intro.ipynb).
[Another notebook](notebooks/heat_equation_1d.ipynb) contains a practical demonstration
on the basis of one-dimenional time-dependent heat transfer.
